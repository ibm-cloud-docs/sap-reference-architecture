## Where can I find the SAP applications that are certified within SAP NetWeaver?
{: faq}

The SAP Business Suite, including SAP S/4HANA and SAP Business Warehouse on HANA, are supported. For specific applications, check the [SAP Product Availability Matrix ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance.html){: new_window} and [SAP Notes ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html){: new_window}. Both require an SAP S-user ID to access content.

## Can I run non-SAP NetWeaver applications, such as SAP Hybris and SAP BusinessObjects?
